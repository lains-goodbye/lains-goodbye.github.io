        Digital glow of computer.. Brain mildly concussed, likely impairment of self recursive awareness… open another tab.. Dullness in forehead.. Mental floodgates have fallen - primordial image flashes.. ZAP! .. central nervous system..
    </p>

        nightcore playing <br>
        Dissolution of the self. physiological response? <br>
        Internet as.. collective unconscious? As.. neural network? As.. simulacra regime that is in dialectical evolution with the ‘real world’ As… Communion? <br>
        Young Japanese girl kills herself to enter computer. What can this tell us about reality? Much to think about… many symbols. Again brain is hurting.. Pain before growth, is there not? Intuition, lack of continuous connection. Aristotelian distinction between discrete and continuous categories.. Cannot make non-arbitrary distinction of continuous category.. Discrete categories must always be dstingisuiehd in one way or other.. Digital processes - referencing mcluhan here - transform reality from continuous to discrete experience.. But mental processes were always this way, no? Where do thoughts go in between when you think them and when you answer them? Digital process: material becomes the mental..

        Mitski.. I need hapa wife NOW! Black and white video, pretty half-caucasian woman.. Warm shower on sunday night after day out with family.. Hair is wet sit at desk.. Dark night outside.. Crickets chirping.. Maybe should go for walk? Soon this moment will be lost. Like tears in rain. Bladerunner.. Fleeting nature of intimacy.. Artificial love… P1. Freud was pessimistic about human love.. P2. Freud was smarter than me.. C1 = ?? <br>
        Psychological projection inevitably faces disillusionment.. The fundamental birth trauma.. Reality is divorced from the will.. Basis of all trauma.. The continual assertion of the will upon the world as goal of life.. project an unrealistic image.. You love like someone who does not want to be loved in return.. You pursue them like someone who does not want to succeed in pursuit… But can also be resolved by accepting the world as that which one wills? Click… click… click… thats how brain goes… infinite japanese schoolgirls online.… never grow old… one kiss on forehead on tuesday 5 pm… golden sunset, must catch train soon.. She goes on the green line.. That’s not your line, is it? .. you watch her walk off… when will you tell her your feelings? You don’t know. Nobody ever knows anything.. The computer is my friend.. The computer is growing a brain. Computer what do you think ? why dont you share? What if the singularity future consists of this.. Infinite Tuesday evenings.. Humid.. Red sun.. full virtual reality repetitions of single sacred moment.. feeling of sentimentality.. An empty classroom.. Something inside you is transforming.. A bird cries.. You check the time – So late! Blink.. the feeling is gone.

        Computer talk to me, can you bring it back? Computer I will do anything for it back.. I need my Lain… voltage pole in distance, walk up hill back to suburban neighbourhood… dinner with parents.. Do they know your secret? Do they know your transformation? Father’s glasses hide his eyes.. Who is Father, really? You wish you could know. There is something mysterious about them you don’t understand. There is something mysterious about yourself… <br>
        It is Sunday night. You are not the same.
